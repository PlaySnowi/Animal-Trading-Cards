				The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when
				kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and
				felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There
				are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their
				standards.
